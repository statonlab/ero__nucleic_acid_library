# ero__nucleic_acid_library

This is a Tripal 3 field for displaying Library information on an organism bundle.  

It will simply display a table of all chado.library items (which are now multiple bundle types) linking to those bundles.

Right now it only attaches to Organism.


# Installation

This is not a module.  It is a standalone field designed to be enabled as a library.  Clone the field into your `sites/all/libraries/TripalFields` directory and enable the libraries API module.
